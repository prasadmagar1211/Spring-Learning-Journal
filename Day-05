# Day 5: Spring Boot Starters - Simplifying Dependencies

Today I explored **Spring Boot Starters**, which are a set of convenient dependency descriptors that can be included in an application.

### 📦 The Concept
Instead of manually searching for and adding multiple library versions that work together, Starters provide a "one-stop shop" for all the related technologies needed for a specific feature.

### 🛠️ Key Starters Explored:
1. **spring-boot-starter-web:** Used for building web applications, including RESTful services using Spring MVC.
2. **spring-boot-starter-data-jpa:** Connects the application to SQL databases using Hibernate.
3. **spring-boot-starter-security:** Automatically adds authentication and authorization layers.
4. **spring-boot-starter-test:** Includes libraries like JUnit and Mockito for testing.

### ⚙️ Why it matters:
Starters eliminate "Dependency Hell" by ensuring that all libraries are compatible with each other out of the box. This reduces configuration time and allows for a faster transition from setup to actual coding.

**Status:** ✅ Day 5 Attendance Marked.
