# Day 11: The Repository Pattern - Abstracting Data Access

Today I dived deeper into the **Repository Pattern**, which acts as a bridge between the domain and data mapping layers using domain interfaces.

### 🏗️ How it Works
In Spring, we don't write implementation classes for our data access. Instead, we create an interface that extends `JpaRepository<Entity, IdType>`.

1. **Abstraction:** The application logic doesn't care if the data is in MySQL, PostgreSQL, or an In-memory database. 
2. **Built-in Methods:** We get `save()`, `findAll()`, `findById()`, and `deleteById()` automatically.
3. **Custom Queries:** If the built-in methods aren't enough, we can use the `@Query` annotation to write JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language).

### ⚙️ Why it matters:
This pattern keeps the business logic decoupled from the data access logic. It makes the code cleaner, 
easier to test with mocks, and allows for easy swapping of database technologies in the future.

**Status:** ✅ Day 11 Attendance Marked.
