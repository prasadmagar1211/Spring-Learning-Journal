# Day 14: Bean Validation - Keeping Data Clean

Today I learned how to use the **Bean Validation API** (Standardized via JSR 380) to automatically validate incoming data before it even reaches the business logic.

### ✅ Common Validation Annotations:
* **@NotNull / @NotEmpty:** Ensures a field isn't null or an empty string.
* **@Size(min=x, max=y):** Restricts the length of a string or collection.
* **@Email:** Validates that a string follows a proper email format.
* **@Min / @Max:** Sets numeric boundaries.
* **@Past / @Future:** Ensures a date is in the past or the future.

### 🛠️ How it's Triggered:
By adding the **@Valid** or **@Validated** annotation in the Controller's method signature, 
Spring Boot automatically checks the object against these rules. If the validation fails, 
it throws a `MethodArgumentNotValidException`, which we can catch with the Global Exception Handler we built on Day 13!



### ⚙️ Why it matters:
It keeps the "junk" out of the database. Instead of writing dozens of `if/else` statements to check if a 
username is too short or an email is missing an '@', we simply declare the rules once on the Entity or DTO.

**Status:** ✅ Day 14 Attendance Marked.
