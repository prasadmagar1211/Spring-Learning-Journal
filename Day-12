# Day 12: The Service Layer - Organizing Business Logic

Today I learned about the **Service Layer**, the middleman that sits between the Controller and the Repository.

### 🧠 The Role of the Service Layer
While the Controller handles HTTP requests and the Repository handles database operations, the Service layer contains the "Business Logic."

1. **@Service:** This annotation marks a class as a Service, making it a Spring Bean that can be injected into Controllers.
2. **Transaction Management:** Services are where we typically use `@Transactional` to ensure that a series of database operations either all succeed or all fail together.
3. **Logic Consolidation:** If a task requires calling multiple Repositories or performing complex calculations, that logic stays here.

### ⚙️ Why it matters:
* **Reusability:** Multiple Controllers can use the same Service logic.
* **Separation of Concerns:** It prevents our Controllers from becoming "fat" and hard to read.
* **Clean Code:** It makes the application much easier to unit test because we can test the logic without worrying about web or database details.

**Status:** ✅ Day 12 Attendance Marked.
