# Day 4: The Spring Bean Lifecycle - Birth to Death

Today I explored the specific stages a Bean goes through within the Spring Container. Understanding this "Birth to Death" cycle is essential for resource management.

### 🔄 The Lifecycle Stages:
1. **Instantiation:** The object is created.
2. **Dependency Injection:** Spring populates the properties.
3. **Initialization:** Custom logic is executed (often via `@PostConstruct`).
4. **Active State:** The Bean is ready for use by the application.
5. **Destruction:** Cleanup is performed before the application context closes (often via `@PreDestroy`).

### ⚙️ Why it matters:
This lifecycle allows for automated resource handling—like opening a database connection when a bean starts and ensuring it closes properly when the app shuts down—keeping the system efficient.

**Status:** ✅ Day 4 Attendance Marked.
