# Day 6: Spring Boot Auto-Configuration - The "Magic" Explained

Today I studied **Auto-Configuration**, the feature that allows Spring Boot to automatically configure an application based on the dependencies added to the project.

### 🪄 How it Works
Spring Boot looks at the **Classpath** (the libraries available in the project). If it sees a specific library, it assumes you want to use it and sets up the default configuration for you.

* **Example:** If `spring-boot-starter-web` is on the classpath, Spring Boot automatically configures an embedded Tomcat server and Spring MVC.

### 🛠️ Key Components:
1. **@SpringBootApplication:** This single annotation includes `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, which triggers the scanning of dependencies.
2. **Conditional Annotations:** Spring Boot uses logic like `@ConditionalOnClass` or `@ConditionalOnMissingBean` to decide whether to create a configuration. It only configures what is actually needed.

### ⚙️ Why it matters:
It removes the need for hundreds of lines of manual XML or Java configuration. It follows the principle of **"Opinionated Defaults,"** meaning it provides a sensible starting setup that you can override only when necessary.

**Status:** ✅ Day 6 Attendance Marked.
